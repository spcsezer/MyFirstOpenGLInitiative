# ExpandOpenGL

- My beginning of OpenGL journey has started

##### What did I until now:
1. Initialize GLFW, GLM, GLEW libraries. So basically, I initialize OpenGL.
2. Create and manipulate window.
3. Draw meshes/models. In the begining of my program, I just draw triangle with given vertices and indices and then, I added custom models via assimp library (Open Asset Import Library).
4. Of course we need a vertex shader and fragment shader for seeing these on 3D dimensional world. To be honest, I still hardly understand these calculations. I'm still learning this üòÅ
5. We need to control our camera for traveling our world.
6. Implemented directional, point and spot lights.
7. Simple game neeeded shadows, So I added shadowmaps. Especially for point and spot light shadows I use cubemap and It was really hard to calculate their shadow. So, I need a very long time to learn theses completely.
8. Finaly the best part was implementing skybox. It was easy and changing game look a lot.

###### This was my first OpenGL publish to the github
